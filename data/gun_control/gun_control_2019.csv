Over the last several years, I've repeatedly supported President Trump's plans to secure our borders. I share the President's frustration that Congressional Democrats have blocked the reasonable and good faith efforts he has made to invest in more personnel, technology, and infrastructure in order to protect the American people. Democratic leaders have made clear their opposition to a serious investment in border security is motivated by their desire to score political points at the President's expense. While there are unobjectionable ways for the President to transfer federal funds to be used for border security, including more than $600 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, I don't believe a national emergency declaration is the solution. It wouldn't provide enough funding to adequately secure our borders, it would likely get tied up in litigation, and most concerning is that it would create a new precedent that a left-wing President would undoubtedly utilize to implement their radical policy agenda while bypassing the authority of Congress. As Speaker Pelosi explicitly noted, liberal Democrats would certainly embrace scenarios like: · A President Bernie Sanders declaring a national emergency to implement the radical Green New Deal, including shutting down power plants, causing energy prices to skyrocket. · A President Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation's financial institutions. · A President Cory Booker declaring a national emergency to effectively end Second Amendment Rights.

Then yet the leaders in Congress have votes that do not reflect the will of the American people. So the only way that can change is if you vote them out. So I'm encouraged by some of the gun control groups and gun safety groups like the Brady Campaign, the Sandy Hook Promise, March for Our Lives, the Giffords' group. What is happening is, especially for March for Our Lives, there is a group of young people fed up with all of these school shootings. They are setting up these chapters all over the country. What each chapter is trying to do is get people to vote. The reason we don't have sensible gun laws is the NRA has always been really powerful and has always funded elections at the grassroots level. Now these groups that I'm talking about are actually starting to fund elections themselves. So as the money evens out and influence evens out, these younger generations are going to impose the will of the people. The vast majority of people don't think AR-15's should be allowed in the hands of a citizen. Or high capacity magazines. They want background checks, as I mentioned.

We will not speculate about the possible use of the Virginia National Guard. However, based on the twitter responses, Maj. Gen. Williams' words were not comforting. A Militia Is Forming in Virginia Tazewell County is taking this threat to the Second Amendment seriously. They have not only passed a Second Amendment Sanctuary resolution, but they have also officially begun to form their own militia. Law Enforcement Today reports: Just this past Tuesday, on December 10 th, the Board of Supervisors from Tazewell County passed two different resolutions in light of the controversy circling those who are pro-gun. The first resolution declared the county to be a second amendment sanctuary. This is not at all surprising to see, as 76 out of 95 counties, 9 out of 38 independent cities, and 13 towns have adopted second amendment sanctuary resolutions. The second item on the agenda was the proposition of establishing a militia in the county. When both of the resolutions passed, the crowd cheered loudly in support of the decisions. Also, the resolutions didn't exactly pass by a small margin; the votes were unanimous, with more than 200 citizens standing by in support. County Administrator Eric Young explains why the county opted to form a militia: Our position is that Article 1, Section 13, of the Constitution of Virginia, reserves the right to `order' militia to the localities. Therefore, counties, not the state, determine what types of arms may be carried in their territory and by whom. So, we are `ordering' the militia by making sure everyone can own a weapon. Thus, is anyone from the state tries to remove the Sheriff from their elected office because they refuse to enforce unjust laws, those state officials will be faced with a lawful militia composed of citizens within the state.",Timothy P.

A synagogue in Poway in my state, California, and a school in Charlotte, North Carolina. There's an article in today's Washington Post titled, `The Latest Shooting Attacks Show How the U.S. Stands Apart from the World' it ends with the line, `It may not be possible to completely replicate Australia's success, but why there has been no effort even to try is a question that puts national lawmakers to shame.' I agree. It's far past time for my Republican colleagues to join me in passing commonsense gun reform. This Congress I am proposing three pieces of legislation. An assault weapons ban, an extreme risk bill and a bill to raise the legal age to purchase assault weapons to 21, just 21 years old, which would match the existing age restriction for handguns. Senators Blumenthal and Murphy and others have legislation that requires universal background checks. A large majority of Americans supports this requirement and the House has already passed it this year. Finally, I'd just like to remember two Americans. Lori Gilbert-Kaye, a 60-year-old worshipping at Chabad Poway, who stepped in front of the gunman in the shooting to save others, including her rabbi, Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein. The second is Riley Howell, a student at UNC Charlotte in class yesterday when the shooting broke out. He reportedly charged the gunman, pinning him down until officers arrived, very likely saving the lives of his fellow classmates and giving up his own in the process. These two are heroes and they are victims in an unnecessary, relentless stream of gun violence. I've been on this committee for a very long time, 25 years. I authored the assault weapons [ ban ]. It existed for 10 years. Mass shootings diminished during those times. And yet, now no restrictions and event after event after event. It's very hard for me to believe that any one of us carry out our responsibility by allowing these kinds of things to happen unchallenged.",Dianne Feinstein,['Q230733'],2019-05-03 12:39:24,1,"[['Dianne Feinstein', '0.5949'], ['None', '0.4051']]",['http://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/index.php/news/local-news/18454-senator-dianne-feinstein-calls-for-commonsense-gun-reform-proposes-three-pieces-of-legislation-an-assault-weapons-ban-an-extreme-risk-bill-and-a-bill-to-raise-the-legal-age-to-purchase-assault-weapons-to-21'],E

2230521,2019-08-08-045542,"is providing [ the weapons ] to Syrian rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country [ in December 2015 ]. -- Michael Chossudovsky, Global Research, 2019 One of the secondary effects (I suspect intentional) of the government and law enforcement narrative on mass shooting incidents (sic) is one that emphasizes a need to control the mentally unstable (a fluid definition that likely will include you and me at some point). Since the Philip K. Dickian idea of * future crime * is now relatively mainstream the focus on mass state quarantines of those who serve as potential threats is clearly implied in the master narratives on these shootings. The bourgeoisie respond to the death of white people (and OK, a few hispanics, too) with exaggerated horror. They do not show such horror at the atrocities in Yemen or Syria or Libya, committed by US/NATO. But then the lone gunman story is containable and easily grasped by their truncated moral GPS. The white liberal does not scream gun control when cops execute another unarmed young black man (or woman). Just as gun makers are ignored in the gun control logic, so are cops. The anti gun lobby seems okay with the idea that only steroid crazed racist policemen can carry guns. I have to tell you, I'm not so OK with that. The familiarity of the rhetoric that surrounds these shootings has come to have a numbing effect. Still, it is important to note that as Adorno and Horkheimer observed that anti semitism grew in the U.S. after the defeat of the Nazis. So the love of guns and death seems to grow after each of these mass shootings. But the rise in gun related deaths contains another less advertised fact: While much of the public attention is on the intense tragedies of gun massacres in the US -- 2017 saw the deadliest mass shooting by an individual to take place in the country in modern history, when 58 people died in the 1 October rampage on the Las Vegas Strip -- in fact most suffering takes place in isolated and lonely incidents that receive scant media coverage. Of those, suicide is by far the greatest killer, accounting for about 60% of all gun deaths.",Gabor Mate,"['Q1212684', 'Q1212694', 'Q1645755']",2019-08-08 15:48:50,1,"[['Gabor Mate', '0.5381'], ['None', '0.4619']]",['https://dissidentvoice.org/2019/08/blood-in-our-eyes/'],E

2477916,2019-08-07-057799,"Michelle and I grieve with all the families in El Paso and Dayton who endured these latest mass shootings. Even if details are still emerging, there are a few things we already know to be true. First, no other nation on Earth comes close to experiencing the frequency of mass shootings that we see in the United States. No other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do. Every time this happens, we're told that tougher gun laws won't stop all murders; that they won't stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak. We are not helpless here. And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening. Second, while the motivations behind these shootings may not yet be fully known, there are indications that the El Paso shooting follows a dangerous trend: troubled individuals who embrace racist ideologies and see themselves obligated to act violently to preserve white supremacy. Like the followers of ISIS and other foreign terrorist organizations, these individuals may act alone, but they've been radicalized by white nationalist websites that proliferate on the internet. That means that both law enforcement agencies and internet platforms need to come up with better strategies to reduce the influence of these hate groups. But just as important, all of us have to send a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy. We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don't look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people. Such language isn't new -- it's been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, here in America and around the world. It is at the root of slavery and Jim Crow, the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. It has no place in our politics and our public life.
