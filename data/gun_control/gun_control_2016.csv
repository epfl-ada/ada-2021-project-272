5771499,2016-09-28-081462,"My bill will refocus the debate on the real homeland security issue of Islamic Terrorism rather than the false narrative of gun control. It is also important to remember that radical Islamic terrorists will use any and every tool at their disposal to kill those who oppose their beliefs; whether it is an airplane, a boat, truck, pressure-cooker, knife, or a gun. Any government official who focuses on the method more than the terrorists themselves is making a disastrous mistake. That is exactly what seems to be happening in government today, but I am hopeful that this legislation will correct that problem. This legislation respects due process, while reducing the number of people residing in the United States who appear on a terror watch list, thus freeing up limited law enforcement resources to pursue other cases. This has become of particular importance in recent months as there have been multiple acts of terrorism committed by people who had been previously investigated by the FBI for ties to terrorism. Freeing up law enforcement resources by reducing the number of people residing in the United States who are suspected of terrorism will keep America safer. This is the better way -- rather than harming the 2nd Amendment rights of American citizens, this bill will ensure that non-citizens suspected of terrorist ties are removed from the country. We know that more than 90% of the folks on this list aren't American persons at all. This will take a concrete step towards making America safe again.

I supported the Manchin-Toomey bill, which would have required background checks on all commercial sales of guns, including sales at gun shows and internet sales, as well as strengthened the existing instant check system by encouraging states to put all their available records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In addition, I cosponsored legislation to close a loophole that allows gun sales to proceed if a background check is not completed after 72 hours, even if the gun buyer is not legally allowed to purchase a gun. I also authored the Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act, which would hold people responsible if they sell or transfer a firearm to someone who is barred by federal law from possessing firearms.

Notwithstanding that, the police officers charged Mister Smith and his entire family and to compound the already grieving state that they were, they were carted off to prison having been charged under the now accepted and recognized draconian gun law which puts all persons who reside at a particular premises to be cast under this wide net and this discriminatory web which is a most unfortunate situation, as Mister Smith can certain attest to. And so we've finished the trial of the matter. There were five witnesses for the claimant, Mister Smith and the five persons who were charged; those being his wife Miss Sandra Casey, his son Leon Smith, his daughter Tamika Smith and his niece Isheida Brooks. And for the defendant, we had the arresting officer, Mister Castellanos and the other officer. We are now at the stage where we will be making legal submissions to the judge tomorrow afternoon as it relates to the legal requirements for proof, which we are claiming took place; those being false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. So that will take place tomorrow afternoon. But you were in court this morning and you'd see that the matter did proceed very quickly and I must say that in relation to the tort of malicious prosecution, what needs to be told is that they were charged; the charge was dismissed and the police officers at the time that there was no reasonable basis for the charge to have been brought and that goes along with the fact that there would have been malice. If you have no reasonable basis to charge somebody then it is imputed that it is based on malice.

8032674,2016-09-27-082583,"On Tuesday September 20th, Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police, who reportedly approached Mr. Scott for suspicion of possession of marijuana and possession of a gun in an open carry state. This death, like so many more, was avoidable. To the family of Keith Scott, we offer our sincerest condolences. To the protesters in Charlotte who are raising their voices against racially biased policing, we stand with you. To the stakeholders in the criminal justice system, we call on you to heed the call for change. While the details of this killing remain contested, the persistence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system is clear and deeply troubling. Study after study after study confirms what our communities of color have been telling us for decades: race influences who is stopped, who is searched, who is arrested, who is subject to use of force, who is held on bail, who is convicted, and who is sentenced to harsher punishments. This appalling reality cannot continue. As public defenders, we stand for the right to due process for people of all races, creeds, and incomes. Today, we renew our pledge to eradicate the plague of racial inequity in our justice system. We recognize and respect the steps that have been taken by some police, prosecutors and judges in our state towards that goal. Still, we can -- and must -- do better. We were dismayed by CMPD's gross lack of transparency in the days following the shooting. Chief Putney did not release any videos until five days after the shooting, and only did so after intense public pressure and the independent release of a video taken by Mr. Scott's wife. Withholding this evidence only furthered the mistrust between civilians and police. Likewise, the implementation of a law preventing the public from viewing body camera or dashcam footage of events of utmost importance to the public will do nothing to heal the open wounds made visible by the Charlotte protests. We can appreciate the need to carefully gather and review evidence before determining whether to charge or admonish an officer. The stark contrast, however, between the treatment of an officer-as-suspect and civilian-as-suspect further highlights the need for a searching and thorough reckoning with the absence of equity in our criminal system. The North Carolina Public Defender Committee on Racial Equity invites the public and criminal justice stakeholders to join us in sincere dialogue and concrete action to create the system that we deserve and so desperately long for.",None,[],2016-09-27 10:51:11,2,"[['None', '0.7633'], ['Keith Scott', '0.2367']]","['http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2016/09/27/public-defender-group-weighs-in-on-charlotte-police-shooting/', 'http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2016/09/27/public-defender-group-weighs-in-on-charlotte-police-shooting/print/']",E

9648024,2016-05-04-017827,"Donald J. Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday with a landslide win in Indiana that drove his principal opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, from the race and cleared the way for the polarizing, populist outsider to take control of the party. After months of sneering dismissals and expensive but impotent attacks from Republicans fearful of his candidacy, Mr. Trump is now positioned to clinch the required number of delegates for the nomination by the last day of voting on June 7. Facing only a feeble challenge from Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Mr. Trump is all but certain to roll into the Republican convention in July with the party establishment's official but uneasy embrace. In the Democratic contest, Senator Bernie Sanders rebounded from a string of defeats to prevail in Indiana over Hillary Clinton, who largely abandoned the state after polls showed her faring poorly with the predominantly white electorate. But the outcome was not expected to significantly change Mrs. Clinton's sizable lead in delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. Mr. Trump's victory was an extraordinary moment in American political history: He is now on course to be the first standard-bearer of a party since Dwight D. Eisenhower, a five-star general and the commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, who had not served in elected office. Mr. Trump, a real estate tycoon turned reality television celebrity, was not a registered Republican until April 2012. He has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats, including his likely general election opponent, Mrs. Clinton. And, at various points in his life, he has held positions antithetical to Republican orthodoxy on almost every major issue in the conservative canon, including abortion, taxes, trade, and gun control. But none of this stopped him. With his ability to speak to the anxieties of voters, and his shrewd use of celebrity and memorable put-downs, Mr. Trump systematically undercut veteran politicians in a field of candidates that many in the party had hailed as the strongest in at least three decades. He was underestimated by leading Republicans and Democrats time and again, and he succeeded while spending far less money than most of his rivals and employing only a skeletal campaign staff.",None,[],2016-05-04 09:01:12,1,"[['None', '0.5805'], ['Bernie Sanders', '0.1721'], ['Donald Trump', '0.1556'], ['Hillary Clinton', '0.0502'], ['Ted Cruz', '0.0416']]",['http://apicciano.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2016/05/04/donald-trump-wins-big-in-indiana-primary-ted-cruz-suspends-his-candidacy/'],E

That's scary to me as an American, as a woman, as an African-American woman, that I could be in a city, at a protest and someone is walking around with a high-powered assault rifle, and yet, I don't know if that's okay. Because we're telling people if you see something, say something, if you see something, do something. But people are confused. They don't know if that was a legitimate place for him to be with that gun or not.
