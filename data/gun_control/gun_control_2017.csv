And what we just saw here is one of the bad sid effects of someone not exercising those rights properly. But we're not going to get rid of freedom of speech becuase some people say some really ugly things that hurt other people's feelings. We're not going to get rid of Fourth Amendment search and seizure rights because it allows some criminals to go free who should be behind bars.

My heart sunk to the pit of my stomach, once again, when I heard of today's shooting in Texas. My heart dropped further when I thought about the growing macabre club of families in Las Vegas and Orlando and Charleston and Newtown, who have to relive their own day of horror every time another mass killing occurs. None of this is inevitable. I know this because no other country endures this pace of mass carnage like America. It is uniquely and tragically American. As long as our nation chooses to flood the county with dangerous weapons and consciously let those weapons fall into the hands of dangerous people, these killings will not abate. As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets. Ask yourself -- how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents. My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago.

There is a long road ahead for the Las Vegas community and the families who have been directly impacted by this horrendous act of domestic terrorism. We send our love and support. While we wait for more information to be released and the investigation to be completed, we cannot ignore that fact that rapid-fire weapons of war were used to brutally murder innocent Americans who were simply attending a live concert in Las Vegas. Over and over again, military-style assault weapons are the weapons of choice for mass shooters due to the sheer lethality of their design. Assault weapons are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible. After the Sandy Hook tragedy and other mass shooting incidents, thoughts and prayers are offered by Congressional members who stand with the NRA. But these members of Congress have failed to do their job to keep all Americans safe. Taking action to reduce gun violence should not be a political issue. It is a matter of public safety and public health. We implore all members of Congress to dig deep and find the courage to immediately reject the NRA policy proposals that loosen our gun laws and pass a package of sensible federal gun laws similar to what was passed in Connecticut after the Sandy Hook tragedy in a bipartisan manner. Just one month ago, the NRA-supported Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act (SHARE Act) was introduced in the House of Representatives. This act would deregulate silencers, making them readily available without background checks at gun shows and on the Internet. We implore all members of House of Representatives to reject the SHARE act and instead pass laws that require background checks for sale of all guns; ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines; repeal the legal shield for the gun industry; and adequately fund federal gun violence research. Congress must also reject any effort by the NRA to allow gun owners from states with poor permitting laws to carry their concealed weapons in other states. Over 500,000 Americans have been killed or injured by guns since the Sandy Hook shooting tragedy. The Las Vegas massacre was the 272nd American mass-shooting incident in 2017. Too many Americans are getting killed in public spaces. Until our federal gun laws are strengthened, we are all vulnerable to becoming victims of gun violence in our country. We encourage all Americans to demand action from their congressional representatives by calling them at 202-224-3121.",Dannel Malloy,['Q714269'],2017-10-02 21:44:33,1,"[['Dannel Malloy', '0.7573'], ['None', '0.2427']]",['http://www.wfsb.com/story/36502323/las-vegas-shooting-sparks-dialogue-over-gun-control'],E

We need to offer them something else. And I know a lot of people have been saying don't politicize this, don't disrespect the victims by calling for gun control. But I'd argue that if we'd had any respect for the victims, we would have done something 20 years ago, 30 years ago, when Columbine happened or Sandy Hook or Aurora. Name any one of these mass shootings that happens pretty much every week in our country. If we had any respect for our citizens we would've had discussions before. So, for people to say don't have that discussion now, now is not the time. When the hell is the time? That's what I want to know. I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe people should be able to protect themselves, should be able to own a handgun or a hunting rifle. But I also believe that mentally ill people shouldn't be able to buy guns. I believe there should be serious training for anybody buying a gun. I believe there should be universal background checks. It should be a process, so we can keep people safe. That shouldn't be too much to ask when you think about what we've done to protect our citizens in other areas. 9/11 happens and what do we do? We take our shoes off when we go to the airport, we can't bring water through. We do much more extensive background checks of people coming into the country. We even have a Muslim ban even though there is no proof that's going to protect us. We do all kinds of stuff, talk about building a wall, right? We do everything to protect our citizens, unless it's one of our own citizens mauling each other and massacring each other with a gun because of the Second Amendment.
