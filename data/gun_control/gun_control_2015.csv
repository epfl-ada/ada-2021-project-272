5853211,2015-07-15-102417,"The announcement between the P5 +1 and Iran is a historic accomplishment. Building on the Lausanne framework, it will ensure that Iran's nuclear program is -- and will remain -- a peaceful one, or that the international community will have more than enough time to respond if Iran's program proves otherwise. This deal will extend the time it would take for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a first nuclear explosive device to a year for at least ten years, from the current breakout time of just two to three months. Drawing on the vast scientific and technological expertise from across the Department of Energy's National Laboratory system, Department and Lab experts helped shape the nuclear negotiations through rigorous technical analysis. The Department of Energy backs the deal and stands ready to assist in its implementation. This agreement will be implemented in phases -- with some provisions in place for 10 years, others for 15 and others for 20 or 25 years. Iran has committed to the Additional Protocol indefinitely as part of its adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty regime. This agreement is the result of tireless work from our experts at the Department and the National Labs, our interagency colleagues and specifically, Secretary of State John Kerry and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman. The U.S. multi-agency delegation worked together collegially and seamlessly, and the P5 +1 displayed remarkable cooperation and cohesion throughout this complex endeavor. These are tributes to Secretary Kerry's personal commitment and leadership. I also want to thank the Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Salehi (MIT PhD' 77) for his dedication to this process. His professionalism, dedication and commitment to advancing Iran's nuclear science and education programs, while at the same time building the international community's trust in Iran's nuclear program, were key to this agreement. This is a good deal for America, for our allies, and for our global security. Most important, this deal is based on hard science and analysis.

In this country, with its traditions, public sentiment and, most importantly, Second Amendment, them's fightin' words. Obama didn't say them. Nor did he seriously address the other approach that could make a difference: more aggressive psychiatric intervention. These massacres are almost invariably perpetrated by severely disturbed, isolated, often delusional young men. Yet even here, our reach is limited.... The problem is that these mass-murder cases are fairly unusual. Take Roseburg. That young man had no criminal history, no psychiatric diagnosis beyond Asperger's, no involvement in public disturbances. How do you find, let alone lock up, someone like that? There are 320 million Americans. Schizophrenia affects about 1 percent of the population. That's about 3 million people. Only a tiny fraction are ever violent -- and predicting which ones will be is almost impossible.... In the final quarter of his presidency, Obama can very well say what he wants.

The individual should be held accountable for his or her actions, and with the access to information the general public has today, I think the name would come out eventually - and it might as well come from credible sources. But I think it's worth re-assessing how we as the media cover mass shootings (and worth noting that mass shootings related to gang violence are covered very differently than school shootings, for example). In some cases, the shooters seem motivated by the notoriety they know they will receive once their horrific acts become part of the 24-hour news cycle. Leaving behind lengthy manifestos about why they did it and elaborate plans for how to execute the violence, these people want to be known. It's hard for the media to do anything but play into their wishes and provide a platform for their message. I mean, we can't ignore a mass shooting. But I think dwelling less on the `why' in our coverage could help. Will we ever find a satisfactory explanation for that type of violence? These tragedies become politicized when we try to explain the why behind them. Based on their particular interests, different groups will use a mass shooting to build a case for more gun control, better mental illness services, concealed carry, a tougher stance on bullying and any other cause that can be attached to the event. These are important issues to consider and worthy of media coverage. But let's delve into them without the name of a mass shooter attached.

In Alabama, the lion's share of the people who want to do so go to a pawn shop, gun store or any dealer that holds a federal firearms license. According to a report released by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives on July 10, there are 2,371 active licenses in the Yellowhammer state. Buying from a licensed dealer means submitting to a check run through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which usually ensures that convicted felons and other persons prohibited from owning a firearm aren't able to buy one. According to FBI statistics, 308,542 NICS checks have been run in Alabama so far in 2015. Interestingly, that puts the state at No. 9 in the nation for number of checks run this year, despite being No. 23 by population. Of course, the system is not without flaws. FBI Director James Coney said last week that Dylann Roof should not have been able to buy the firearm he allegedly used to kill the nine victims in Charleston. Coney said a clerical error and the discretion of the licensed dealer Roof bought from allowed him to purchase the gun even though the NICS check should have prevented it.",President Barack Obama,['Q76'],2015-07-20 13:00:00,1,"[['President Barack Obama', '0.6391'], ['None', '0.2796'], ['Dylann Roof', '0.0813']]",['http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/07/armslist.html'],E

We consider that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) the United States and its partners negotiated with Iran will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future non-proliferation agreements. This is an innovative agreement, with much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated non-proliferation framework. It limits the level of enrichment of the uranium that Iran can produce, the amount of enriched uranium it can stockpile, and the number and kinds of centrifuges it can develop and operate. The agreement bans reconversion and reprocessing of reactor fuel, it requires Iran to redesign its Arak research reactor to produce far less plutonium than the original design, and specifies that spent fuel must be shipped out of the country without the plutonium being separated and before any significant quantity can be accumulated. A key result of these restrictions is that it would take Iran many months to enrich uranium for a weapon... Concerns about clandestine activities in Iran are greatly mitigated by the dispute resolution mechanism built into the agreement. The 24-day cap on any delay to access is unprecedented, and will allow effective challenge inspection for the suspected activities of greatest concern: clandestine enrichment, construction of reprocessing or reconversion facilities, and implosion tests using uranium... [ W ] e find that the deal includes important long-term verification procedures that last until 2040, and others that last indefinitely under the NPT and its Additional Protocol. On the other hand, we do believe that it would be valuable to strengthen these durable international institutions...

However, underlying the hearing is a real possibility that the right to firearms will be infringed. Therefore, in light of the liberty and property interests involved, placing the burden of proof on the veteran is highly suspect. Under similar circumstances, the burden is generally on the government. Further, the hearing that takes place is inside the VA administrative system and composed of VA employees rather than a neutral decision maker. Under the current practice, a VA finding that concludes that a veteran requires a fiduciary to administer benefit payments effectively voids his Second Amendment rights-a consequence which is wholly unrelated to and unsupported by the record developed in the VA process.
