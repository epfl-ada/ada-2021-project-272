In total, six gun bills passed easily through the State Senate and Assembly, a remarkable sight in a Capitol that for years had resisted almost all new legislation on the subject. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, last ushered a major gun safety package into law in 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.. The governor successfully corralled recalcitrant Senate Republicans into supporting the so-called Safe Act that expanded the state's ban on assault weapons, tightened certification requirements, increased criminal penalties for illegal guns and closed private sale loopholes. Mr. Cuomo has described the Safe Act as one of his signature achievements. `Sometimes history irrefutably bears out your actions,' the governor said on Tuesday, at a news conference lined with gun safety advocates. `Today is the next evolution in this ongoing crusade.' The relative ease of the laws' passage highlighted, for the second time in just two days, the upheaval that November's election brought to Albany.

The controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will continue to have an environmental monitor present during these activities as well as on-going clearing activities. As with all border barrier projects, CBP conducted biological, cultural, and natural resource surveys of all new border wall system projects currently being executed in the Tucson Sector including the area of Monument Mountain within the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. In addition, CBP has and will continue to coordinate with federal land managers, state agencies, local governments, tribal governments, and other interested stakeholders to obtain information about the possible presence of sensitive resources that may be within the project areas and to develop site-specific construction best management practices to be implemented by the contractor during construction activities that avoid or minimize impacts to resources to the great extent possible. Based on the environmental surveys and stakeholder coordination completed, no biological, cultural, or historical sites were identified within the project area, which consists of the 60 foot wide swath of land that extends from the international border north and is known as the Roosevelt Reservation. Recently the construction contractor began controlled blasting on Monument Hill within a 5 foot wide area of the Roosevelt Reservation that is immediately adjacent to the international border for the purpose of loosening rock in order to allow for the construction of a footer for the new border wall. CBP's environmental monitor is present during these activities to ensure that if any previously unidentified culturally sensitive artifacts are observed within the project area that construction is halted and the appropriate stakeholders are notified to include tribal nations.

4513883,2020-02-15-028128,"It's nice to finally be able to do what I think the majority of Virginians have wanted for a long time,'  Democratic Del.. Mark Levine said. Lawmakers in the House and Senate have voted to end a state holiday honoring Lee and Jackson and instead are making Election Day an official holiday. They spent Tuesday - the deadline for each chamber to pass its own version of legislation-passing dozens of other bills, including a measure to incrementally raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and legislation to allow local governments to remove Confederate statues. That bill comes in the wake of a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, sparked in part by the city's attempt to remove a Lee statue, that turned violent. Lawmakers also have advanced this year: - a renewable energy measure that will likely raise electric rates but, environmentalists say, make the state among the greenest in the country by signing up you agree to our terms of service-comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation-bills that abortion-rights advocates say will make Virginia a'  safe haven'  for women in neighboring conservative states-resolutions to make Virginia the critical 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, a major victory for women's - rights advocates - a repeal of a provision requiring voters to show ID before casting a ballot. The legislature, led by the first female House speaker and with the highest number of African-Americans in leadership positions in the state's 400-year history, is set to give final passage to most pieces of landmark legislation ahead of the March 7 adjournment. The highest-profile fight has been on Democrats' push for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and a ban on selling assault weapons, after last year's fatal shooting at a government complex in Virginia Beach. Many Democrats campaigned on the issue in 2019, and gun-control groups heavily funded candidates. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's gun-control measures passed the House, but the more-conservative Senate has blocked some of the measures, including the assault-weapons ban. Despite a largely conservative history, Democrats have had a large footprint in Virginia for years. It was the only state in the South to pick Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Democrats have made sizable gains in other legislative elections. The most recent blue shift has been fueled in large part by the state's growing suburbs, particularly in Northern Virginia, where voters are more likely to be immigrants, college-educated, and liberal.'  The Northeast megalopolis has sort of migrated down to Virginia,",None,[],2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"[['None', '0.9633'], ['President Donald Trump', '0.0367']]",['http://dailyherald.com/article/20200215/news/302159971/'],E
