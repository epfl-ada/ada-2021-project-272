President Obama has refused to enforce federal law. Today I was proud to support the House-passed Conscience Protection Act. This much needed legislation strengthens current law in response to California and New York's recent rules that all health care plans within the State cover abortions, including those purchased by churches and other religious groups. These rules have even forced pro-life nurses to participate in gruesome dismemberment abortions. Importantly, this bill also provides the right to sue based on discrimination due to an individual's moral or ethical beliefs with respect to abortion. It is unconscionable that the government would so blatantly disrespect an individual's moral and religious objections to ending the life of another human being in order to advance the pro-abortion agenda.

3992993,2016-12-21-090636,"the view has been ventured by Muslim jurists that the Indo-Anglican judicial exposition of the Islamic law of divorce has not exactly been just to the Holy Prophet or the Holy Book. Marginal distortions are inevitable when the Judicial Committee Downing Street has to interpret Manu and Muhammad of India and Arabia. The soul of a culture -- law is largely the formalised and enforceable expression of a community's cultural norms -- cannot be fully understood by alien minds. The view that the Muslim husband enjoys an arbitrary, unilateral power to inflict instant divorce does not accord with Islamic injunctions.... It is a popular fallacy that a Muslim male enjoys, under the Quranic law, unbridled authority to liquidate the marriage. The whole Quran expressly forbids a man to seek pretexts for divorcing his wife, so long as she remains faithful and obedient to him: `if they (namely, women) obey you, then do not seek a way against them' (Quran IV:34). The Islamic law gives to the man primarily the faculty of dissolving the marriage, if the wife, by her indocility or her bad character, renders the married life unhappy; but in the absence of serious reasons, no man can justify a divorce, either in the eye of religion or the law. If he abandons his wife or puts her away in simple caprice, he draws upon himself the divine anger, for the curse of God, said the Prophet, rests on him who repudiates his wife capriciously.... Commentators on the Quran have rightly observed -- and this tallies with the law now administered in some Muslim countries like Iraq -- that the husband must satisfy the court about the reasons for divorce.

We also recognize the many legislators that supported this legislation, including the majority of women legislators. This important bill empowers women considering abortion with additional reflection time before an abortion so they can consider their options more effectively. Since abortion facilities in Louisiana are only in the business of selling abortion, this reflection period allows for further consideration of other choices, including adoption and parenting. In situations of coercion or violence, HB 386 gives a woman more time to reach out for help before being forced into an abortion they do not want.

He shipped more than six thousand embryos each to China and Russia under false documentation, and more thousands to the Ukraine and Cyprus. He took embryos from scores of Ontario's leading Holstein and Jersey breeders, but the lawyers involved in the case decided they couldn't easily prove theft. They could prove massive fraud. In some cases, Hill falsified the breeding slips for artificial insemination, the identity of the dam, the breeding date and the embryo recovery date and health certificates. Some of these frauds were so blatant that a novice ought to have noticed, such as embryo recoveries from one donor cow two weeks apart and recoveries of 18 embryos per collection when the average is seven. The Chinese set high standards for what they wanted to buy from Hill. In fact, he identified only six cows that qualified, yet shipped them more than 6,000 embryos all collected within a year. It's one thing for Hill to cheat this way. It's another for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to be so asleep at the switch that it never noticed. Its veterinarians signed the paperwork clearing the embryo exports. Its veterinarians failed to notice collection dates two weeks apart for the same donor cow. Its veterinarians failed to notice Hill apparently collected more than 6,000 embryos from six cows within less than a year. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is supposed to audit registered embryo collection centres.

In the 1970s, chemotherapy improved survival for those without metastasis in the lungs or bones, and limb salvage surgery became feasible. However, there have been no advances since then for those with metastatic disease. Those children still only rarely survive. Improving survival by diminishing the likelihood of metastasis is therefore a therapeutic, but difficult, priority. Our long term goal is to understand how metastatic cells move through tissue in enough detail so that we can block those movements. Interestingly, metastatic cells are little living, cooperative engines and are analogous to cells that move from place to place in the developing embryo. We are therefore using an embryonic model system to speed the discovery of basic mechanisms of cell migration through tissue. This effort involves state of the art 4D imaging of live specimens at submicron resolution combined with genetics as well as new methods that our lab invented to measure physical forces that move cells about. A key endpoint to our work will be identification of molecular pathways that are relatively specific to migratory cancer cells and which can be blocked pharmacologically or genetically to reduce the likelihood of successful metastasis.",None,[],2016-08-24 19:58:25,1,"[['None', '0.683'], ['Andrea Bowen', '0.317']]",['http://www.northumberlandtoday.com/2016/08/24/go-gold-for-childhood-cancer-awareness-month'],E

2543705,2016-09-22-135060,"Today, The Globe and Mail published an article outlining that I was in fact born in Mashhad, Iran and not in Herat, Afghanistan -- as I was led to believe for my whole life. Because I know my story has resonated with many Canadians, I wanted to take the time today to clear any misconceptions this may have unintentionally caused. In recent days, my mother told me for the first time that my sisters and I were in fact born in Mashhad, Iran, approximately 200 kilometers from the Afghan border. Following my parents' wedding in Herat, the local security situation became untenable. The town was severely damaged by war and thousands were killed. No longer safe in their home town, my parents decided not to take risks and went to Mashhad, Iran, where they could be safe -- with the hope of soon returning to the place their families called home for generations. While we were technically safe in Iran, we did not hold any status there and like the thousands of other Afghan refugees, we were not afforded all of the same rights and privileges given to Iranian citizens. After my father's death, we travelled back and forth between Afghanistan and Iran when the security situation permitted it. My sisters and I asked my mother why she never told us we were born in Iran. She told us she did not think it mattered. We were Afghan citizens, as we were born to Afghan parents, and under Iranian law, we would not be considered Iranian citizens despite being born in that country. Some survivors believe healing comes from telling their story; others cannot fathom revisiting the past. My mother never talked about the unspeakable pain that conflict and terror inflicted on her. This week my sisters and I asked her to re-live that pain. Conflict has robbed me of a father and it has scarred my family and I for life. We thankfully found a welcoming home in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, where we began the challenging and difficult process of resettlement. Coming to Canada as a refugee-twenty years strong - and now a member of Cabinet in the 42nd Parliament -- I feel a tremendous deal of responsibility in upholding all that this great country has allowed me to become. This includes accountability to the public and transparency. Canada has played an important role in allowing me to become who I am today.
