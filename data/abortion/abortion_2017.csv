One of the main concerns that brought me to the decision to run for this office was hearing from residents who wanted a fair; firm, and unbiased Magistrate in the Valley. I will provide a strong, but impartial presence, helping to alleviate and deter the crimes and illegal drug use that we continue to endure. We must feel compassion for our fellow man but also expect and hold one to personal responsibility. I will administer justice in an unbiased manner, upholding legislation. No one will receive preferential treatment in my courtroom nor does one need to be a personal friend in order to expect justice. One of the other main ideas that brought me to running for this office concerns parenting. There is a lack of concern in some areas of our community regarding the responsibility of the parent. It seems some parents are under the misconception that raising a child today should be left up to the schools, social services, law enforcement or even the courts.

Take Rosie Jimenez, for example, a woman from the RGV who died because she didn't have enough money to afford an abortion. Hers was the first case after the passage of the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funds for abortion. Collectively, both laws threaten the viability of the support systems Texan women rely on for the reproductive healthcare they need, and HB 214 will especially hurt women of color, like what happened with Rosie. Study after study has demonstrated what is at stake for these vulnerable groups when barriers to reproductive care are increased. One can only come to the conclusion that these proposals are motivated by a larger agenda to prohibit access to abortion care for Texan women at the risk of already proven negative consequences.

1274413,2017-04-03-083419,"Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin estimates it could keep open only two of its 19 family planning clinics -- those in Milwaukee and Madison -- if it was barred from billing Medicaid programs. That was one of the provisions in the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. And though that plan was withdrawn last month, the organization is sure to remain a target. Yet, paradoxically, cutting off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood would not affect its two clinics that provide abortions in Wisconsin. Those clinics, which do not receive government dollars, are separate from its family planning clinics. They would remain open. `That's why Republicans are being disingenuous about this,' said Nicole Safar, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. The Republican plan to replace parts of the Affordable Care Act would have prevented any provider of abortions, except in rare cases, from billing Medicaid programs for one year. More than 6 in 10 patients who receive care at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Wisconsin are covered by a Medicaid program. For its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, that meant 37,675 of its 59,762 patients. Medicaid programs accounted for $10.8 million, or almost 44 percent, of its $24.8 million in revenue that fiscal year. `We don't have a way to fill the gap,' Safar said.

Furthermore, as radical leftists of the baby boom generation assumed important positions in politics, academia, and the media, it should not have been shocking to see millennials with a contrarian streak respond by taking embracing right-wing radicalism. Not all such young people, of course, but enough to make waves. Another misconception about racism is that education is a panacea. Overall, higher education does apparently lead to lower levels of racial hostility. Yet again, the alt-right complicates this picture. The typical alt-right supporter does not lack education. The movement's skillful use of the internet alone suggests otherwise. In interviews with people in the alt-right -- including the movement's leading voices and anonymous Twitter trolls -- I found at least some degree of college education was a common denominator.

The next thing we know, my mom comes back to the car with a tall Asian man. Mom told us his name was Yu. She had just met him in the checkout line and was giving him a ride home.

She was often giving rides, bringing food, visiting people who were house bound and helping families navigate the cultural differences here in America.

Mom talked Yu and his wife through this scary situation. She told them about God's love and plan for this baby and urged them not to have an abortion. She also connected them with a Pro-Life group in their area. Yu and his wife listened to my mom and welcomed a baby boy into the world.

I wanted to take a moment to share the curriculum objectives of this unit and make myself available if you have any questions on this topic or any other topics we are discussing in health and wellness class. The curriculum objectives of the unit are as follows: Students will be able to: • Identify the stages of the human life cycle from prenatal to late adulthood. • Identify characteristics of healthy relationships and demonstrate communication skills that foster them. • Recognize and define sexual harassment and understand school's sexual harassment policy and legal implications. • Differentiate between gender identity and sexual orientation. • Describe a range of ways to express affection in relationships including safe and risky sexual behaviors and their potential outcomes. • Identify the benefits of abstinence, postponing sexual behavior, and setting limits on sexual behavior. • Demonstrate refusal skills relating to abstaining from sexual behaviors, including abstinence. • Define STIs/STDs including HIV/AIDS and how they are and are not transmitted. These health lessons include evidence-based activities from Get Real: Comprehensive Sex Education that Works c. 2013 and are in accordance to the National Health Education Standards, the National Sexuality Education Standards, and the Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum Framework. If you would like to preview the curriculum, a copy of materials is available in the front office at Ford Middle School. The five lessons in the Healthy Relationships and Human Sexuality unit are as follows: Lesson 1: Human Development Lesson 2: Sexual Harassment & Sexual Identity: Respecting Differences & Boundaries Lesson 3: Deciding About Sexual Behavior Lesson 4: Defining and Maintaining Abstinence Lesson 5: Introduction to Sexually Transmitted Infections You have the right to have your child opt out of these lessons.

My team and I have carefully researched every aspect of information available on Rani Padmavati for making the film. There was never any alleged romantic scene, dream sequence or imaginary song between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in the script.

While we have clarified this multiple times across various media platforms, the vandalism against the film deeply pains me. This violence is unjustified and not acceptable as it is merely based on hearsay, allegations and accusations, and not on facts.

We do not intend to hurt the sentiments of any community and can confidently say that Mewar will be proud of the film.

3316164,2017-05-03-086429,"NASHVILLE -- As evangelicals gathered here last week, expectations were high about the upcoming announcement of an administration executive order on religious liberty. But so were anxieties. Christian author Rod Dreher made no effort to hide his skepticism about President Trump.' I don't think he cares about the thing that matters most to us, and that is religious liberty,' Dreher said from the stage. The marriage of evangelicals to Trump, Dreher added, will not end well.' I think it's going to be a bitter harvest for us,' he said. No one seems to know what Trump's executive order will say, because it has been so closely held by Vice President Mike Pence and a few aides. A draft version that was leaked to the Nation magazine soon after the inauguration was broadly worded to create `wholesale exemptions [ from anti-discrimination statutes ] for people and organizations who claim religious or moral objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity,' according to the magazine. But there is reason for religious conservatives -- including Pence, a deeply conservative Christian -- to worry about how the final version will read. The president's daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner are more aligned with gay, lesbian and transgender groups on the issue. In fact, some observers believe the leak to the Nation was orchestrated by someone in Jared and Ivanka's orbit to sabotage the process. `The Jared and Ivanka thing, that's real,' said one congressional aide.",John Ward,"['Q19517860', 'Q20984604', 'Q21463743', 'Q23023271', 'Q41044515', 'Q55754448', 'Q56650075', 'Q56849120', 'Q56849121', 'Q6262976', 'Q6262978', 'Q6262991', 'Q6262992', 'Q6263001', 'Q6263011']",2017-05-03 13:30:00,1,"[['John Ward', '0.9017'], ['None', '0.0748'], ['Mike Pence', '0.0146'], ['Donald Trump', '0.0089']]",['http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/roundup/morning-briefing-madison-continues-efforts-to-activate-trouble-spot-at/article_3b71959a-2ff6-11e7-bab1-9fde920e2f44.html'],E
