This original position is not, of course, thought of as an actual historical state of affairs, much less as a primitive condition of culture. It is understood as a purely hypothetical situation characterized so as to lead to a certain conception of justice. Among the essential features of this situation is that no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance. This ensures that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged in the choice of principles by the outcome of natural chance or the contingency of social circumstances. Since all are similarly situated and no one is able to design principles to favor his particular condition, the principles of justice are the result of a fair agreement or bargain.",John Rawls,['Q1282521'],2020-02-03 08:39:47,1,"[['John Rawls', '0.9026'], ['None', '0.0974']]",['http://geopolicraticus.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/the-blank-slate-of-outer-space/'],E

The goal, they say, should be to discredit accusers without eviscerating them. Eviscerating them could turn off a jury. In Weinsteinâ € ™ s case, the task is all the more daunting. News reports about his alleged predation of scores of women -- from high-profile actresses to production assistants -- launched the #MeToo movement in late 2017. â € œOf course, a lawyer has to go in there and attack credibility and attack inconsistencies.

For all of those we got 1 normal embryo from that and 2 low level mosaic (mosaic means there are some abnormal cells but can still lead to a healthy baby) So we feel lucky we got 1! But what a drop off right? Anyway I have so appreciated everyone sharing their Ivf stories with me. They made me feel empowered and supported. So I wanted to tell you how mine went down. So many women go through many rounds of ivf which is painful and mentally gruelling. I heard from hundreds of women about my their miscarriages and struggles and also many hopeful stories about how after rounds and rounds of ivf it worked!! It has been really encouraging. Thank you. Anyway I am so grateful for our son and that we have the resources to get help in this way. I just wanted to share and send love and strength to all of the warrior women who go through this process.
