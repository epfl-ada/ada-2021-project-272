On the basis of their isotopic signatures, terrestrial volatiles are thought to have derived from carbonaceous chondrites, while the isotopic compositions of nonvolatile major and trace elements suggest that enstatite chondrite -- like materials are the primary building blocks of Earth. However, the C/N ratio of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is superchondritic, which rules out volatile delivery by a chondritic late veneer. In addition, if delivered during the main phase of Earth's accretion, then, owing to the greater siderophile (metal loving) nature of C relative to N, core formation should have left behind a subchondritic C/N ratio in the BSE. Here, we present high pressure-temperature experiments to constrain the fate of mixed C-N-S volatiles during core-mantle segregation in the planetary embryo magma oceans and show that C becomes much less siderophile in N-bearing and S-rich alloys, while the siderophile character of N remains largely unaffected in the presence of S. Using the new data and inverse Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the impact of a Mars-sized planet, having minimal contributions from carbonaceous chondrite-like material and coinciding with the Moon-forming event, can be the source of major volatiles in the BSE.",None,[],2019-01-24 12:47:46,1,"[['None', '0.7699'], ['Rajdeep Dasgupta', '0.1212'], ['Priyanka Gandhi', '0.1089']]",['https://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2019/01/delivery-of-carbon-nitrogen-and-sulfur-to-the-silicate-earth-by-a-giant-impact.html'],E

933383,2019-06-10-033181,"I started having PCOS symptoms at 16. My periods were agony. I had terrible mood swings and gained weight very easily. I also grew hair all over my chest and face. It was awful. By the time I was 19, some days I didn't want to get out of bed, so I went to the doctor thinking I had depression. Although I was overweight at 13 1/2 stone and 5ft 6ins tall, I didn't look huge so at first my GP didn't even think of PCOS. But when everything else was ruled out, he sent me for a blood test and ovarian ultrasound and I was diagnosed. I was given the contraceptive pill to ease my symptoms but it didn't help much. When my now-husband and I wanted to start a family a couple of years later, I came off the pill but couldn't get pregnant. I was referred to a specialist who told me I'd find it extremely difficult to conceive naturally and put me on the fertility treatment waiting list. Meanwhile, I'd heard about Norah, who worked locally, and her success at treating PCOS, so I visited her and tried her diet. Natalie Wilson, 26, with her daughters Annabelle May, four, and Adalynn Eva, almost two Cutting out carbs was easier than I thought and all the mini snacks meant I wasn't hungry. Also, I felt better eating real food -- lots of chicken and fresh fruit and veg. Even eating a tiny morsel every 15 minutes wasn't hard -- I set my phone alarm and managed to do it for about fours hours a day. The transformation was incredible. After two weeks I had loads more energy, my mood levelled out and I'd lost seven pounds. Within four weeks I'd had a normal period -- my first in months. Over the next few months I lost three and a half stone, my periods became regular and all my other PCOS symptoms -- including the facial hair -- eased. Then, to our delight, I fell pregnant with Annabelle May who was born in May 2015. I couldn't believe it -- nor could my specialist. I continued to see Norah to keep myself on track and went on to have our second daughter, Adalynn Eva, in July 2017. I now know exactly what I have to do to control my symptoms and stick to the diet plan, so I can enjoy life with my husband and girls.
