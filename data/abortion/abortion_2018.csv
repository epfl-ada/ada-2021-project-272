The demonstrations came at a time of reckoning for many men in Hollywood, the media and other industries as women speak out about sexual misconduct and inequity in general. Among the speakers in Las Vegas was singer and actress Cher. `This is one of the worst times in our history and that's why I honestly believe that women are going to be the ones that fix it,' Cher told the crowd. `Stay strong and remember if you don't have a vote, you don't have a voice.' Those who took part in this year's events said they were galvanized by an avalanche of political and gender issues over the past year, as well as the #MeToo movement, which has been credited with countering widespread sexual abuse and misconduct.
