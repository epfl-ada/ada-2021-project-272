7531128,2015-10-29-034986,"How do consumers distribute their spending among different goods? Answering this question is not only necessary for explaining and forecasting actual consumption patterns, but also crucial in evaluating how policy reforms, like changes in consumption taxes, affect the welfare of different groups. In his early work around 1980, Deaton developed the Almost Ideal Demand System -- a flexible, yet simple, way of estimating how the demand for each good depends on the prices of all goods and on individual incomes. His approach and its later modifications are now standard tools, both in academia and in practical policy evaluation. How much of society's income is spent and how much is saved? To explain capital formation and the magnitudes of business cycles, it is necessary to understand the interplay between income and consumption over time. In a few papers around 1990, Deaton showed that the prevailing consumption theory could not explain the actual relationships if the starting point was aggregate income and consumption. Instead, one should sum up how individuals adapt their own consumption to their individual income, which fluctuates in a very different way to aggregate income. This research clearly demonstrated why the analysis of individual data is key to untangling the patterns seen in aggregate data, an approach that has since become widely adopted in modern macroeconomics. How do we best measure and analyze welfare and poverty? In his more recent research, Deaton highlights how reliable measures of individual household consumption levels can be used to discern mechanisms behind economic development. His research has uncovered important pitfalls when comparing the extent of poverty across time and place. It has also exemplified how the clever use of household data may shed light on such issues as the relationships between income and calorie intake, and the extent of gender discrimination within the family.",None,[],2015-10-29 23:28:27,1,"[['None', '0.7037'], ['Angus Deaton', '0.2963']]",['http://morungexpress.com/nobel-laureate-reflects-on-un-development-agenda/'],E

The life she chooses could be to have five children and stay home and homeschool them. The life she chooses could be to go on to work. But a woman should have the opportunity to choose her own life. Unfortunately, these words get politicized, and the word feminist got politicized by the National Organization for Women, and NOW is clearly a political organization. They want to put forward a particular political agenda. So, for example, Hillary Clinton during the 2014 elections said, when she was campaigning against Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) for Bruce Braley, she said, `well, it's not enough to be a woman, you have to be a woman who believes,' and she then went on and listed the liberal orthodoxy. And that is how these folks think, that unless you fit their orthodoxy, you don't count as a woman, you don't count as an African-American, you don't count as a Hispanic.

Issues like that seem so huge, when we think of statistics. Each year 47% of Indian girls and 14 million girls globally marry before they reach 18. It's so easy to feel like these problems are insurmountable, that poverty, gender bias and traditions like dowry are too deeply entrenched to change. But I like to tell stories that get at what we can do about our problems, not simplified cheerleading, but taking a complex look at what it takes for things to change. I was pretty clear I wanted to focus on a girl empowerment story and after my experience making and distributing Smile Pinki, I was eager to work in India again. I feel like there is an unprecedented conversation going on in India about gender and how girls are valued. And everyone who works on these issues knows that adolescence is a crucial time in a girl's life and small investments in girls' lives have big payoffs. I knew I wanted to focus on a story where you see that clearly. So I started to talking to friends and advocates who are focused on these issues.

4901818,2015-06-10-018865,"I didn't choose my public life, but it did give me a platform to help make body politics newsworthy. Matters like the taboo of the nipple in the 21st century, public breastfeeding, slut shaming, fat shaming, breast cancer awareness, body positivity, gender inequality, and censorship have found their way into mainstream discussion. But unfortunately the emphasis in the press has been on sensationalizing my breasts, chiefly in terms of my family. There are also some people who would criticize my choice to relate nipples with equality at all. To me, nipples seem to be at the very heart of the issue. In the 1930s, men's nipples were just as provocative, shameful, and taboo as women's are now, and men were protesting in much the same way. In 1930, four men went topless to Coney Island and were arrested. In 1935, a flash mob of topless men descended upon Atlantic City, 42 of whom were arrested. Men fought and they were heard, changing not only laws, but social consciousness. And by 1936, men's bare chests were accepted as the norm. So why is it that 80 years later women can't seem to achieve the same for their chests? Why can't a mother proudly breastfeed her child in public without feeling sexualized? Why is a 17-year-old girl being asked to leave her own prom because a group of fathers find her too provocative? Why should I feel overly exposed because I choose not to wear a bra? Why would it be okay with Instagram and Facebook to allow photos of a cancer survivor who has had a double mastectomy and is without areolas but `photos with fully exposed breasts, particularly if they're unaffected by surgery, don't follow Instagram's Community Guidelines.
