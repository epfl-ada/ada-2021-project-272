The aim is to address the challenges and find solution to the obstacles faced women globally. The United National states that one out of every 3 women in the world face violence.

1421168,2020-02-28-082560,"We know ahead of time how this evening will play out, Polanski wrote in his statement. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor but fled the country on the eve of sentencing. Last year, a Frenchwoman came forward to accuse Polanski of raping her in 1975 in his Swiss chalet when she was 18. Polanski denied it, and the allegations are too old for an investigation. But the accusation put the director under fresh scrutiny in France, where he has long been revered as one of the country's premier filmmakers despite the outstanding rape charge in the US Other accusations have also emerged. Polanski's An Officer and a Spy, about anti-Semitic persecution of French army Capt. Alfred Dreyfus and his wrongful treason conviction in the 1890s, is up for multiple Cesars on Friday. Polanski, who survived the Holocaust in Poland as a child, said this year's awards have no place for a film whose subject is defending truth and fighting injustice, blind hate and anti-Semitism. Polanski, 86, said he decided not to attend the ceremony to protect his colleagues and his wife and children. However, critics say he is using the film to paint himself as a victim of unfair persecution. The parallel that is made between the anti-Semites who attacked Dreyfus and feminists of today who fight for equality between men and woman and the end of impunity for sexual offenses is simply disgusting, Celine Piques, of activist group Osez le Feminisme, told The AP. Fellow activists painted banners ahead of a demonstration planned outside the Cesars. Roman Polanski is not a victim, he is not a persecuted man, he is just a rapist, a child rapist, who is protected by the whole world of cinema in France,",None,[],2020-02-28 07:48:21,1,"[['None', '0.5404'], ['Roman Polanski', '0.4596']]",['https://www.news18.com/news/movies/top-nominee-roman-polanski-to-skip-french-oscars-after-rape-claim-2518915.html'],E

Amy Klobuchar had won every election they ever ran. Sanders firmly denied Warren's accusation and said it was â € œincomprehensibleâ €  to believe he would suggest a woman couldn't become the president. â € œOf course a woman can win, â €  he said. â € œI donâ € ™ t know that thatâ € ™ s the major issue of the day. â €  Just six candidates gathered in Des Moines, each eager to seize a dose of final-days momentum on national television before Iowa's Feb. 3 caucuses. The sudden â € œhe-said, she-saidâ €  dispute over gender involving two longtime allies, Sanders and Warren, loomed over the event, though it was not a focus in the debate's earliest moments. Specifically, Warren charged publicly on the eve of the debate that Sanders told her during a private 2018 meeting that he didn't think a woman could defeat Trump, a claim tinged with sexism that Sanders vigorously denied. Amid an immediate uproar on the left, there were signs that both candidates wanted to deescalate the situation. The feuding on other topics, including war and foreign policy expanded to include nearly every candidate on stage by night's end. Sanders has recently stepped up his attacks on former Vice-President Joe Biden over Biden's past support of the Iraq War, broad free-trade agreements and entitlement reform, among other issues. Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar, who has had several strong debates, looked for opportunities as she remained mired in the middle of the pack in polling. Billionaire Tom Steyer faced criticism that he's trying to buy his way to the White House. And with two surveys showing Pete Buttigieg losing support in Iowa, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, needed a breakout moment to regain strength before the caucuses. Trump, campaigning in neighbouring Wisconsin just as Democrats took the debate stage, tried to encourage the feud between Sanders and Warren from afar. â € œShe said that Bernie stated strongly that a woman canâ € ™ t win.

Working with my team, we decided to push back, and the tweet that we sent out caught people's imaginations. Knowing that Girlguiding UK had a survey where one in six under 12 girls said they felt ashamed about their bodies, I thought we should auction the dress for that charity. I was assuming we would get about 500 quid if I was lucky-but £ 20,200! It was just incredible. I was so pleased and they were thrilled. For me [ the sexism ] sort of doesn't matter, I can put up with it-but there are other people in other jobs, other women, who can't speak out because they don't have that power. I've got a very loud voice and I have the ability to speak up on their behalf and fight back against everyday sexism. The reaction has felt completely positive and I've had an awful lot of support from within the party, from around the country, Labour members and non-Labour members. People in the street have stopped me and said, `I love what you did with the dress' . Would I be likely to speak out again? No doubt about it. It's my obligation.

On the other hand it could be very sincere, by an artist who sits outside of the canon, as obviously it doesn't have the kind of rendering of most celebrated painters' work. The feminism aspect of it could be in terms of a relationship to anti-high art, a sense of trying to redefine what a visual art practice might look like that might challenge what we think of as good, or would historically have been considered good at least. It could be playing with the language of feminine painterly practice. There seems to be some kind of idea behind it, the brush strokes are very considered and bold.
