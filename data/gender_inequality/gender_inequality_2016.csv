I would like to make it clear that the only truth in that is the separation rest all is untrue. The reason behind the separation is unknown to anyone but me. Many of my best friends and well-wishers in this industry, including media friends, were insisting me to speak out. But I thought discussing my private life in public would do no good to the cause. At this juncture, my father, as a typical father, was pained at the unpleasant developments in my family life and expressed his disappointment on the same to a channel when he was forced to do so. Sadly, that is being taken as the sole source of all the speculations and debate. I'm conscious of my social responsibility. I have so far directed nine films. The portrayal of women in my films with dignity and self-respect reflects the amount of respect I have towards them. I strongly advocate women and their freedom of choice. When Amala wanted to continue her career in films, I supported her to the best of my ability. And she continued acting even after marriage. The new-found accusations that I or my family were stopping her from work are completely untrue. The base for any marital relationship is honesty and trust. When that is breached, the very existence of committed relationship becomes meaningless. I really value the institution of marriage and relationship a lot. Not even in my worst dreams did I think it will end. But yes, today, I don't have any choice. With lots of pain in my heart, I have decided to move on in life in a dignified manner. The gender bias in certain sections of the media without knowing the actual facts damages the personal and professional integrity of mine, which is much more painful than the original episode of departing. Lastly, I would be grateful if people respect our personal lives and space as their very own and not delve into any more speculations based on stray rumours.

The Daily News ran a correction yesterday, May 7th, for which I am grateful. To clarify, the interview actually took place on February 9th, 2015, one and a half weeks after I had first announced my Ghostbusters cast via Twitter, a week and a half that saw my actors and I inundated with some of the most hateful tweets, posts and comments I had ever seen. My quote was in answer to the question, `Has the paradigm shifted to a point where (because geek culture is currently so popular) the geek is the asshole now?' I very much regret saying in my answer that I had actually met any assholes from the geek community. I have never met anyone from the geek world face-to-face who wasn't a warm, kind person. The `assholes' of which I speak are the ones who live online, who write those hateful tweets and posts and comments. I'm not talking about the people who have true concerns and worries about the rebooting of a franchise they love, nor am I talking about people who have watched the trailer for our movie and didn't like it. Those are all valid opinions and I respect them all. I am talking about those that write misogyny and hate and threats. Those are the `assholes' of which I spoke. As a lifelong geek and proud member of the geek community (as well as the creator of the TV series Freaks and Geeks), I abhor bullies. Every community has bullies who make up a very small minority of the community as a whole. Bullies scream the loudest and seem to get the most attention. But they are simply bullies who in no way represent the vast majority of wonderful, thoughtful people who make up our geek community. The geek world has been a haven for so many of us and we should all refuse to let these bullies hijack the conversations and debates we all love to engage in, nor should we let them represent our community and culture to the rest of the world. The bullies are not the norm and I would dare say they are not even true geeks. They are the micro minority.

6780255,2016-05-24-066896,"More horrifying were the attempts to desecrate the Host in sexual acts. One prostitute was forced to listen to Sade's frenzied arguments against the existence of God over the course of a long night. As news got out, Sade became a hate figure for the press, and was found guilty by public opinion. [... ] Sade's distress at his confinement, combined with his sense of entitlement, sexual peculiarities, hatred of religion and an obsession with numerology, gave rise to his precisely ordered fantasies of lust, omnipotence, cruelty and revenge -- fantasies that some argue prefigure Nazism. [... ] In many ways, Sade was a startlingly modern thinker. He despised the notion that women were merely vessels for procreation and celebrated their orgasmic potential.

I would like to make it clear that the only truth in that is the separation rest all is untrue. The reason behind the separation is unknown to anyone but me. Many of my best friends and well-wishers in this industry, including media friends, were insisting me to speak out. But I thought discussing my private life in public would do no good to the cause. At this juncture, my father, as a typical father, was pained at the unpleasant developments in my family life and expressed his disappointment on the same to a channel when he was forced to do so. Sadly, that is being taken as the sole source of all the speculations and debate. I'm conscious about my social responsibility. I have so far directed nine films. The portrayal of women in my films with dignity and self-respect reflects the amount of respect I have towards them. I strongly advocate women and their freedom of choice. When Amala wanted to continue her career in films, I supported her to the best of my ability. And she continued acting even after marriage. The new-found accusations that me or my family were stopping her from work is completely untrue. The base for any marital relationship is honesty and trust. When that is breached, the very existence of committed relationship becomes meaningless. I really value the institution of marriage and relationship a lot. Not even in my worst dreams did I think it will end. But yes, today, I don't have any choice. With lots of pain in my heart, I have decided to move on in life in a dignified manner. The gender bias in certain sections of the media without knowing the actual facts damages the personal and professional integrity of mine, which is much more painful than the original episode of departing. Lastly, I would be grateful if people respect our personal lives and space as their very own and not delve into anymore speculations based on stray rumours.

How do we break the oppression of the sanctioned walls of the dollhouse? Perhaps we must venture into the forbidden room and risk encountering the unthinkable in ourselves. In the room of secrets, we are confronted with a critical choice: accept and reconcile our secrets to our daylight lives, or cut ourselves off from vital parts of our psyche.

I would like to make it clear that the only truth in that is the separation rest all is untrue. The reason behind the separation is unknown to anyone but me. Many of my best friends and well-wishers in this industry, including media friends, were insisting me to speak out. But I thought discussing my private life in public would do no good to the cause. At this juncture, my father, as a typical father, was pained at the unpleasant developments in my family life and expressed his disappointment on the same to a channel when he was forced to do so. Sadly, that is being taken as the sole source of all the speculations and debate. I'm conscious about my social responsibility. I have so far directed nine films. The portrayal of women in my films with dignity and self-respect reflects the amount of respect I have towards them. I strongly advocate women and their freedom of choice. When Amala wanted to continue her career in films, I supported her to the best of my ability. And she continued acting even after marriage. The new-found accusations that me or my family were stopping her from work is completely untrue. The base for any marital relationship is honesty and trust. When that is breached, the very existence of committed relationship becomes meaningless. I really value the institution of marriage and relationship a lot. Not even in my worst dreams did I think it will end. But yes, today, I don't have any choice. With lots of pain in my heart, I have decided to move on in life in a dignified manner. The gender bias in certain sections of the media without knowing the actual facts damages the personal and professional integrity of mine, which is much more painful than the original episode of departing. Lastly, I would be grateful if people respect our personal lives and space as their very own and not delve into any more speculations based on stray rumours.

But now, you are not allowed to ask any questions about the childhood of gay people anymore. It's called `homophobic' .

Seventy-five percent of those affected by disaster are in fact girls and women. Think Nepal with the grotesque spike in sex trafficking after the earthquake in 2015. During Super Typhoon Yolanda, UNFPA reports 900 women a day gave birth in so-called makeshift clinics without so much as a skilled birth attendant present. And girls who are the poorest and the most encumbered among us after a disaster are 2. 5 times more likely to miss school than our brothers.

We continue to see the principles of patriarchy embedded in old colonial values, which play out in Canadian society today.

This system is based on the raping and pillaging of Mother Earth as well as violence against women. The two are inextricably linked. With the expansion of extractive industries, not only do we see desecration of the land, we see an increase in violence against women. Rampant sexual violence against women and a variety of social ills result from the influx of transient workers in and around workers' camps.
