2868740,2019-06-15-000169,"[ The ] inability to repeat even our own results was utterly frustrating,' Professor Sajantila said. As the team refined their methods, however, the initial results were shown to be accurate. `We understood this quite early, but it took long to confirm these findings,' said forensic scientist Jukka Palo. Even with the surprising findings confirmed, the question remained as to whether these individuals were local to the region -- or were they instead recent immigrants, or simple passers by? To find out, the researchers switched to analysing the enamel in the preserved teeth. The enamel, they found, contained isotopic signatures that indicate that the people had lived and grown up in the Isokyrö region before being buried underwater. While the identities of the buried people may now be clearer, the intent behind the water burial remains murky. Archaeological surveys of the area have not revealed any contemporary settlements near the Levänluhta site, suggesting that the lake could have been a far-flung and possibly sacred space. Past hypotheses have suggested that the burial site could have been a human sacrifice, or a mass grave for slaves or people that died through famine, plague or war. However, researchers now believe that the site may have instead been a special burial place for individuals who were different in some sense, or belonged to a specific group within the society. `This is supported by the fact that the individuals were all buried in water, which is unique in Finland, by the gender bias of the deceased, and by the peripheral location of the site compared to contemporary sites in the area,' the researchers wrote. `The Levänluhta project demands further studies, not only to broaden the DNA data but also to understand the water burials as a phenomenon,' said paper author and bone specialist Kristiina Mannermaa, of the University of Helsinki. `The question `Why?' still lies unanswered,",Antti Sajantila,"['Q11852232', 'Q46499972']",2019-06-15 10:29:35,1,"[['Antti Sajantila', '0.9235'], ['None', '0.0765']]",['https://infosurhoy.com/science/human-remains-found-in-unique-and-mysterious-finnish-water-burial-were-ancient-sami-people/'],E

757228,2019-03-26-078005,"Serpell's debut is a rich, complex saga of three intertwined families over the course of more than a century. The epic stretches out from a single violent encounter: in the early 20th century, a British colonialist adopts North-Western Rhodesia (now Zambia) as his home, settling in the Old Drift, a settlement near Victoria Falls, where the colonist gets into a fateful skirmish with a local hotelier. After this, readers first meet Sibilla, the hotelier's granddaughter, a woman born with hair covering her body, who runs away to Africa with a man who frequents the wealthy Italian estate at which her mother is a servant; then, in England, there's Agnes, the colonialist's granddaughter, a rich white girl and talented tennis player who goes blind and falls in love with a student who, unbeknownst to her, is black; and Matha, the servant's granddaughter, a spirited prodigy who joins a local radical's avant-garde activism. In part two, Agnes's son, Lionel, has an affair with Matha's daughter, which leads to a confrontation that also involves Naila, Sibilla's granddaughter. Serpell expertly weaves in a preponderance of themes, issues, and history, including Zambia's independence, the AIDS epidemic, white supremacy, patriarchy, familial legacy, and the infinite variations of lust and love. Recalling the work of Toni Morrison and Gabriel García Márquez as a sometimes magical, sometimes horrifically real portrait of a place, Serpell's novel goes into the future of the 2020s, when the various plot threads come together in a startling conclusion.

5004731,2019-02-20-129413,"When addressing issues around sexism and sexualisation of women in games, it's important to remember that AAA games -- blockbuster, mass market games by major publishers, like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto -- that are often referenced in these conversations aren't actually the only games out there. Nor should they represent the industry as a whole. There's a vast body of work, mostly by independent creators, that does include positive, complex and interesting depictions of women -- games by developers and designers such as Christine Love, Lea Schönfelder, Bahiyya Khan and Jenny Jiao Hsia, for example. For people who are interested in supporting work by and about women that does not adhere to sexist stereotypes, then I'd recommend looking at games by those creators. I do think video game culture has earned its reputation of having poor representation of women, but that is because of deeper cultural issues that plague all art. Video games, as a medium, aren't inherently sexist -- it's the creators and the cultures they function in that are the problem. Sexism needs to be addressed at a deeper level in our societies and cultures before we can see more positive representation of all minorities and women overall. One good way to promote this sort of cultural change is to support and signal boost work by women and minorities. It's easy for smaller creators who are doing progressive work to be forgotten in light of whatever news splash the big AAA games are making, so supporting their work is imperative if video games want to become a better and more inclusive space.",Nina Freeman,['Q22088019'],2019-02-20 15:03:15,1,"[['Nina Freeman', '0.6799'], ['None', '0.3201']]",['https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/18-24-february-2019/are-video-games-inherently-sexist-designers-and-game-makers-share-their-views/'],E

What should be -- and what obviously wants to be -- an inspiring film about a key figure in the fight for gender equality in the second half of the 20th century is instead a film that feels like it was made in a movie factory, pieced together from prefabricated components that work well together and tell a coherent and commendably critical story, but the movie is often without soul. Ginsburg faces the expected onslaught of sexism, both overt and unintentional, that forces her to double down on fighting not only for herself but for everyone held back by their gender. One of the movie's best scenes, one of the few that feels genuine, comes when Ginsburg is looking for a job after graduating from law school. She's been turned down a dozen times, and she spouts off a list of the excuses she's been fed as to why she's unhirable. She would be `too busy at bake sales to be effective.' `Women are too emotional to be lawyers.' Another firm hired a woman a year ago, she is told, and they certainly don't need two. Jones delivers the scene with gusto, from a wounded, but still steadfast, center that tells her she's better than having to face such conspicuous discrimination. The seemingly sympathetic lawyer with whom she is interviewing and shares this story of rejection ultimately does the same, citing his as a `close-knit firm' where her presence would make the lawyers' wives `jealous.' Another flimsy excuse. But such powerful scenes that really get to the point with any kind of resonance are few and far between. Mostly, the movie is a makeshift exercise in theme building, in throwing together chronological highlight reels of Ginsburg's hard work to break through the glass ceilings of her time, which were obviously much higher and much more shatter-resistant in those days.",None,[],2019-03-31 12:15:15,1,"[['None', '0.6606'], ['Armie Hammer', '0.3394']]",['https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=24877'],E

3783480,2019-04-11-005010,"Although academic philosophy divides itself into continental and analytic strands, it is not entirely clear how this division is meant to work. For one thing, it pits a continent against a method, which, as the late English philosopher Bernard Williams once pointed out, is like comparing a car made in Japan with a car that's got four-wheel drive. Moreover, there are many analytic philosophers who are European, and many continental philosophers who are not, and there are many analytic philosophers who read certain continental philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida, and many continental philosophers who steer clear of both of them. In fact, the designation of certain kinds of philosophy as continental is often just an insult: what is really meant is that the philosophy in question is obscure and rococo, and that whatever virtues it has to offer pale in comparison with the logical rigour and precision of the analytic approach. In turn, the retort from many continental philosophers is that logic and precision often mean simply omitting from one's purview the messier swaths of human experience, those that cannot be reduced to the sort of formulas that analytic philosophers prize, such as x is y if, and only if, z. This divide seems to reproduce itself within feminist philosophy. One volume pointedly calls itself the Bloomsbury Companion to Analytic Feminism (2018). The famed online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers separate articles on analytic and continental feminism (although with a separate article on intersections between the two). The article on analytic feminism notes its commitment to careful argumentation and to `the literal, precise, and clear use of language' , while that on continental feminism notes its interest in unveiling precisely those `non-discursive deep-seated biases and blind spots... not easily detected by an exclusive focus on the examination of arguments' . The article on analytic feminism emphasises the importance of the philosophy of language, epistemology and logic; that on continental feminism the importance of postmodernism, psychoanalysis and phenomenology.",None,[],2019-04-11 08:25:37,1,"[['None', '0.8089'], ['Georgia Warnke', '0.1911']]",['https://jewishjournal.com/newsroom/culture/defining-woman/'],E
